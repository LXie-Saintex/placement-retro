                Things I enjoyed most this week: Wireless writeup
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent the week finishing the first draft of Wireless writeup
            </p>
            <p>
                I talked about creating usergroups with the team and the idea was welcomed. When holiday's over, I'll contact 
                one of the Slack admins to create 2 usergroups for WWP, possibly with the name wwp-dev and wwp-product respectively 
                mentions the engineers and the stakeholders.
