               was pretty intense and enjoyable. I learned the below in the hard way:
               <ol>
                   <li>Read the comments at the top: this file might be generated</li>
               </ol> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Conrad's been helping. I am taking time on this ticket and being as autonomous as possible.

                As Craig said, I would leave the team with only very superficial knowledge.

                Been working on Vendor Qualification exam, will do a series of projects over the weekends to cover all points.
                will take a measureup test on Sunday evening.
