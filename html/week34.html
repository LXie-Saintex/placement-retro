                Things I enjoyed most this week: team discussion around automation tests and CircleCI writeup
            </p>
            <p>
                I have created the Slack usergroups and started to set up the wider channel. I only spent Monday on that since no one 
                got back to me about who to include to the channel
            </p>
            <p>
                On Tuesday, we had a fascinating discussion around the testing process & Jira workflow in general. Because the majority of the tasks on the board
                rely on MAIN to implement their part, we had the time to reflect on our current ways of working. We had 2 sessions which really unveiled a lot of
                valid doubts and confusions about the CI. I had a better understanding of the status quo and found out what has been confusing me since I joined the team.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        manual tests were done across the environments and even on PR stage. The complexity of the work is significantly increased as most of the repos do not have 
                        up to date documentations on how to run the projects and almost exclusively rely on low-level plumbing. 
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        the development process is not test-driven. When the code goes into the CI for the first time, there is no test for it. 
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        this is further complicated by the abusive usage of git branching for division of labour. Instead of being an atomic piece, multiple PRs rely on 
                        each other for final completion where the program correctness is confirmed.
                    </li>> 
                    <li>
                        as a result, the code review process is prolonged by the need for piecing together different PRs which often carries little description and requires the reviewer
                        going back and forth between Jira and Github. 
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        Code review lasts even longer when the commit history is not well-groomed to reflect the "true" changes. 
                    </li> 
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The team tried to introduce more environment which is a non-solution to the real underlying problem. Besides, someone told me that creating a "true" PR environment is not worth it 
                and its benefits questionable compared to simple mocked integration tests. I expressed my thoughts on this and argued that it's mainly because we are understaffed to set up and maintain
                PR environments, which can be a constant source of pain from my experience at Sun Savers. I added the team to the CI channel and also started to config a new CI using the existing capabilities 
                shared within the company. I added to README the links to those central repos and hope they will be used more often. I have the impression that the repos are not visible to teams outside MAIN
                and this seems bad.

                <b>Standard points</b>: all of my projects have been reviewed, and I should have covered all standard points except for Point 6 - Design once I made some minor corrections. Craig has filled out his part
                of employer reference. I reminded Jem of it and sent him the example responses. I had a call with Eli who expect to finish his part in next week. Eli made me realise that what I sent might be received 
                differently at the other end, so I offered to walk the line managers through the evidence and verbally explain it if necessary. I will need to go to Craig for comments on Point 13 operational skills as 
                Makers suggest that I had covered that with the MAIN piece. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Synoptic project</b>: I started with Quiz Manager and had a taste of project planning. I learnt about what is the purpose of an MVP and hence what the project planning should look like.
                I did not achieve this week's goals as I had not decided on which tools to use for design or identified any technical weak points. It seems like 1 hour everyday is not enough. Next week I will move on
                to the next project and see if I could catch up with the original plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Maths exam</b>: I did nothing to prepare for it. The courses on BKSB is available again, I will take a test to see where i am and go from there. Currently i have some books and online resuorce to go to. 
                Although i suspect that the internet itself would suffice, it'd be fun to have a small-scale systematic learning of fundamental mathematical concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Programming fundamentals</b>: Haven't done any.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Algorithm training</b>: none.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Side projects</b>: have plenty and worked on none.
