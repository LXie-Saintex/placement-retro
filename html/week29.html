            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: content platform product </p>
            <p>
                WWP-140 is yet unmerged. Made some fixes based on Vasilieos's suggestions and now waiting for approval. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Acting on plan, I gave myself 4 hours everyday to work on the sprint items. I spent the hours exclusively on reviewing PRs. 
                Vasil said that it should take half an hour to review a single PR which was not the case for me. It takes me more than one hour
                as I'd try to understand what the repo is for, what the code is doing and whether the changes are implemented in the best way possible. 
                It was time-consuming and not much new stuff pop up for me to learn. I don't mind though because I think I need this practice 
                to gain muscle memory. I need to be reminded that the more I work with other developers, the quicker I learn. Trying to understand lines 
                of code might be a passive activity, but the communication process would make me more productive in the long run. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to extend the resubmission deadlines by two days. This week was not designed very well as it consisted exclusively of passive learning without
                programming. Also the rewrite took much longer than I thought, I will resubmit on Sunday but still need to reconsider my design on
                the portfolio milestones. I will also "mix it up" in next week. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A plus point is that I lost my notes on excalidraw ðŸŒš .
