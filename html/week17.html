            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: work</p>
            <p>
                Have I learned many new things in this 3-day week? No because I cannot describe anything that I've done. Yes because I 
                solved many problems on my own. It was enjoyable. 
                On Monday I got the apps running on the simulators after deleting <code>yarn.lock</code> and reinstalled dependencies. 
                Looked at Gary's ticket with him and found where they store the state woohoo. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On Tuesday I looked at VQ very briefly and tried to send XMLHttprequest in a web worker, but had to create a server to 
                return xml files, in order to memorize how to parse XML response. In the afternoon, Kristina gave me an overview of EKS migration
                in SunSavers, I picked up a task. Kristina suggested me working on a backend story as well, which is exciting. But I'd finish 
                the current ticket first. 
            </p>

                On Wednesday, my final day of the week. Been setting up to run the CMP services. I built one JAR okay but haven't got to run it
                because of the mismatched dependencies version support. Jem walked us through microservices. I gathered that they were using REST only
                in the beginning, and introduced message bus later(this involves KONG) for the services to communicate at a lower cost. We'll do more of these
                sessions, and I suggested that we do some research first before come on call.
