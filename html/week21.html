            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: writing portfolio</p>
            <p>
                Didn't get to work on the ticket because I haven't got access to the bastions to the databases and the Jenkins pipelines.

                On Monday, I spent some time looking at the ON-HOLD jobs on CircleCI. I wanted to find out if those jobs ever time out and if they contribute to the charged hours. 
                Internet says that they do not consume any computing power or container space. The workflow will have expired after 12 days but the job will sit there
                running forever, which is how we leave things at Savers currently and I find it quite weird.

                Craig reviewed the technical review of MAIN that I wrote and corrected some details. I need to add a section about GraphQL which Craig has introduced as a replacement of the RESTful design. 
                The diagram I downloaded from the Engineernig Productivity team's confluence page is a bit confusing, so I'll draw up a diagram on my own.
                I am not sure if I should explain the move from Akamai to CloudFront as it involves a lot of research. I'm probably a little burnt out from reading a lot of documentations this week...
                I must submit the MAIN project by the end of next week so that I can start writing the background for the Sun Savers project. I'll add the Akamai narrative if I were to have enough time.

                Ideally, by the end of this month, I should have the seconds drafts ready for 2 big projects. My current thinking is that: my portfolio should have 3 big projects that have detailed background information about the
                teams and the technologies; and 2 small projects that consist only of smaller/more fragmented tasks that I did in each team. The big projects demonstrate my understanding of the bigger picture, for example,
                the business context, the decision-making process, the evolution of the problem & solution,  what does the full software development cycle look like in this particular team and why.
                The small ones should showcase my technical skills, such as the ability to solve problems with code, to optimize solutions, to scale when necessary, to communicate efficiently and to follow the best practies.  
                </p>
            <p>
                If I could finish the 2 big projects by the end of September, I can focus on the 2 small projects that target more directly at the standard points in October. 
                I need to pass the Knowledge Module and Function Skills exams in the same month as well I guess. 
                When I get to my 3rd rotation, I'd only need to start 1 big project from scratch. I can start writing it one and a half month into that rotation when I've had some working knowledge about the team to start writing.
                That will be around mid-December, and if the Gateway date is 21st Jan, 2021, it means that even if I finished the last biggie in 3 weeks, 
                I'd have a little more than 1 week to prepare for the final draft of the portfolio as a whole. 
                Hmmmm, the schedule is a bit tight, but I cannot work faster without compromising the quality of the portfolio, so I just need to accept the fact that I'm gonna be busy for the rest of the year and
                cannot be fully productive within the team.
