                Things I enjoyed most this week: CI workflow & cache
            </p>
            <p>
                Looked into persisting data in CircleCI through workflows and cache. it turns out that caching between workflows took longer than downloading at runtime ðŸ˜….

                This week marks the end of rotation & the Karamazovs weeks. I had failed to achieve the goals which are: finish off portfolio and decide on synopctic project. 
                Again and again I find myself lost in between the sprint tasks which I still know nothing about. It's a mystery to me how does testing and deployment work at WWP.
                This has been the most challenging rotation because I needed to take countless initiatives to perform the simplest tasks. I have learnt little and somehow fallen
                out of the habit of maximising input. 
                I am standing on my last leg and straining towards completion. I am confused and defeated and out of my depth. It's been a turbulent process
                and I have lost my focus. I am now in a position to renew my devotion, but not without hesitation. 
            </p>
            <p><b>I found that the most important things are</b>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep eyes on the ball</li>
                    <li>Be a good sport</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><b>I should have been</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>more devoted</li>
                    <li>more disciplined</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
