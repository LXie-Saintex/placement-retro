            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: work</p>
            <p>
                This week is a whole week of correcting my own mistakes. I learnt in a hard way about the detriments of the "Get it over with" mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started to work on the task on Monday. By Tuesday, I understood that I need to apply the same changes to 6 repos. After getting one repo built on the CI successfully, I 
                did the other 5 altogther and merged to the stable branch despite of CI failures. As a result, all service were failing to deploy on dev, staging
                and uat on Wednesday. Only then did I start to look into the failure messages on CI and to learn a handful of K8s commands and concepts, mainly around Controllers. 
                The troubleshooting itself was enjoyable and I couldn't help thinking that how it should have been done properly in the first time. 
                Having learnt my lesson, I was more cautious when applying the fix. Git workflow is easy but things get mixed up when working on multiple projects. 
                I did some boxing-ticking and it helped greatly as I don't need to memorise anything, instead I just observed and reacted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>'Get it over with'</b> is a mistake I make frequently as I often want to move on to the next thing. It's really dumb and harmful to restlessly rush to the next goal. 
                I should treat each task equally and do the right things only. There are some common questions I could ask myself before applying changes:
                what happens after pushing the changes; are the changes sustainable and declarative; is it easy to read and understand
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning K8s is my new fav. K8s and Helm are brand new subjects given my lack of knowledge. I should make notes throughout and study how I study. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowledge Module is not bad at all. I can easily see what do I need to do better when looking at the curriculum. The methods introduced are fascinating too, 
                such as Gantt chart, FTA etc. I could really use these things and I will. 
            </p>

                I only spent 2 mornings on the portfolio instead of 3 as planned. I was supposed to work on the project on Savers but was taken back a little because the documentations 
                live at several places. But the materials seem detailed enough for me to grasp the bigger picture of the team, the programme and the product. 
                I must submit the Savers project before 16th Oct when my holiday begins. I should also pick up more tickets for the last 2 weeks at Savers.
                Not sure what tasks are available at the moment, I should find out and decide which ones will help covering the standard points most.
