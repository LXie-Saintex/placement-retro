            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: work</p>
            <p>
                This week is a whole week of correcting my own mistakes. I learnt in a hard way about the detriments of the "Get it over with" mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started to work on the task on Monday. By Tuesday, I understood that I need to apply the same changes to 6 repos. After one repo passing, I 
                applied to other 5 at the same time, and merged it to the stable branch despite of CI failures. All service were failing to deploy on dev, staging
                and uat on Wednesday. I started to look into the failure messages on CI and had to learn a handful of K8s commands and concepts, mainly around Controllers. 
                The troubleshooting itself is in fact pretty fun even though I basically stopped everything from working ðŸ˜³. I was more cautious when applying the fix,
                and make sure my mind is set on the task, and things turn out well.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, it's an easy mistake to make because I often find myself in a hurry move on to the next thing. I should pay full attention at all time from now on, and
                do the right things only. It's hard to treat each task as equal, but it's dumb to not to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning K8s is my new fav. It's almost a brand new subject given my current knowledge of it. I should make notes throughout and study how I study. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowledge Module is not bad at all. I can see easily what is lacking in my case by looking at the curriculum. The methods introduced are fascinating too, 
                such as Gantt chart, FTA etc. I could really use these things. 
            </p>

                The Work on the Savers project for the porfolio have been on and off this week. I spent 2 mornings on it, and was a little taken back as the documentations 
                live at several places. But it seems detailed enough. It's the priority for the next 2 weeks. Must submit before my holiday begins. The original plan was to
                start a miscellaneous project as well, which I could put off to the holiday week. 
            </p>
