            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: work</p>
            <p>
                This week is a whole week of correcting my own mistakes. I learnt in a hard way about the detriments of the "Get it over with" mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started to work on the task on Monday. By Tuesday, I understood that I need to apply the same changes to 6 repos. After one repo passing, I 
                did the other 5 altogther and merged to the stable branch despite of CI failures. As a result, all service were failing to deploy on dev, staging
                and uat on Wednesday. Only then did I start to look into the failure messages on CI and to learn a handful of K8s commands and concepts, mainly around Controllers. 
                The troubleshooting itself was enjoyable and I couldn't help thinking that how it should have been done properly in the first time. 
                Learnt my lesson, I was more cautious when applying the fix. Git workflow is easy but things get mixed up when working on multiple projects. 
                I did some boxing-ticking and it helped greatly as I don't need to memorise anything, instead I just observed and reacted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                'Get it over with' is a mistake I make frequently as I often want to move on to the next thing. But it's simply dumb and harmful to restlessly rush to the next goal. 
                I should treat each tasks as equal and do the right things only. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning K8s is my new fav. It's a brand new subject given my lack of knowledge. I should make notes throughout and study how I study. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowledge Module is not bad at all. I can see easily what is lacking in my case by looking at the curriculum. The methods introduced are fascinating too, 
                such as Gantt chart, FTA etc. I could really use these things and I will. 
            </p>

                I've been working on and off on the Savers project for portfolio. I spent 2 mornings on it and was a little taken back as the documentations 
                live at several places. But the materials seem detailed enough for me to grasp the bigger picture of the team, the programme and the product. 
                I must submit the Savers project before 16th Oct when my holiday begins. I should also pick up more tickets for the last 2 weeks at Savers.
                Not sure what tasks are available at the moment, I should find out and decide which ones will help covering the standard points most.
