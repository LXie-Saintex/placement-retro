                This week marked the end of the first half of my rotation at Wireless. I had feedback from Eli mentioning how he noticed that I contributed to the team
                with the knowledge I gained from the previous team through communications. Eli also mentioned that I should get more involved in the visual regressin tests,
                which seem to be a large part of the Wireless life, of which i still know little. 
            </p>

                I know clearly that I have not given much technically as I was frustrated and perplexed by the current situation of the project. A good question here is that,
                what is the current situation of WWP, Rita? The answer is I don't know as I gave up knowing once I sensed how brittle it is. I thought I'd contribute more once
                the situation has got better with the effort from the most technically knowledgable, which category I excluded myself from. I shyed away from this challenge because
                I deemed it unrewarding for me and I was eager to learn more about the technologies rather than "how did we end up this s**thole". 
            </p>
            <p>
                That was wrong and i need to do better. I need to find out what is brittle and what are the amends can be made. It is hard but i should have my go. After all, it's
                impossible that I find myself at a good place all the time in the future. I want the mental gymnastics more than the easieness that comes with time. I should be honest
                and grow in public through communication and negotiation. It keeps me present. The "cultivating secretly and come back like a God" way is inhumane and a luxury. i need
                to live in poverty and have my feet on the ground to walk own path.

                Still, working with NewsKit though, what a headache arghh
            </p>
            <p>
                I can help clearing things up with some effort I'm sure. Here's a new issue on the placement retro repo to detail what I will do next about the Wirless situation.
