            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: jq, bash scripting in alpine linux</p>
            <p>
               Started to work on the ticket on Monday. I was explicitly told about what to do with two of the subtasks, so the only thing left for me to tackle was deleting the DNS endpoints in Route53
               created by deployment. Took about a whole morning to figure out how to use git submodule. Kristina walked me through the commands to use to get aws resources listed on my local machine. 
               I had no idea what she was doing when demonstrating, but it was helpful in that it gave me something to look at and research. I started to read about how K8s works, but again it was just too abstract. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On Tuesday I started to work on deleting the DNS endpoints, I first checked what Route53 commands look like and learnt what hosted zones and records are. I had a basic idea of what to do by the end of the day. 
                I also spent the rest of the day trying to understand some existing bash scripts and the circleCI configuration.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Half of this Wednesday was spent on preparing the demo for beginners' club. I researched on CSS fragmentation and demoed <code>box-decoration-break</code>. Still not sure how orphans and widows work. 
                I had started to write a new bash script to delet the records but not sure which executor to use. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of the week was spent on wrestling with jq syntax. I'm pretty sure that I used --slurpfile correctly but the variable was just not reading content from the json files. I used jq's map function in the end
                but I have set up a side project to recreate the --slurpfile problem in order to find out why. I followed Kristina's advice to write some test code first and it has been fun. When I implemented the changes on Friday, 
                the script worked but there is some error-handling left to do. Will do that next Monday. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In both Thursday and Friday evenings, I went through my previous mock exams on Measureup to revise for VQ. I'm supposed to be ready for this by the next Monday, 
                where I'm also expected to submit my first portfolio draft. Might have to move the VQ date further, but I'm reluctant to do so. It's a pain in the arse and I want to get it out of the way.
                So I might spend sometime this weekend to work on it.

                My tech debt is piling up.
