                Pavel is a state of flux where I will be changing teams and wrapping things up. I'm not worried as I'd been feeling the turbulence
                since in Wireless. One thing I'm sure of is that it will be a challenge to find time to code.

                ‚òùüèº I wrote the above paragraph when Pavel just started. It has been so true because i can only describe the last month as turbulent. 
                I had been way distracted by the final placement, synoptic and personal life. I was out of my depth and been a very bad girl (oops) and student.
                The only achievements are: I pushed my portfolio to Stage 3; got 2/3 of the employer reference done. My working hours had been drastically shortened
                because i needed it as I am still on the way to cure the desk injuries.

                I spent little time coding and I am not yet prepared for MAIN when Pavel ended. Too much excitement and disappointment took place. It has been tough but the journey
                was worth it because it had me üôÉ. I am healing and discovering as I move forward as an open shell, not a, uhhh a closed one.

                I have set new goals with new tools. I plan to get the professional-level AWS DevOps certification by the end of 2021. This will encourage me passing the apprenticeship ASAP and 
                separate work and personal learning more. This time I was inspired by the product manager at Wireless to use Google Sheet for planning.

                Next I will need to rethink how to use my personal Slack workspace and News Tech Confluence better. I also want to keep the format of placement-retro 
                for the future journal, just for the old time's sake. A VSCode snippet to attach templates and a better colour scheme are desirable.
