            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: Go workshop</p>
            <p> 
               Raised merge requests regarding the previous two tickets.

                Monday morning, I was working to publish the elm-review rule. I tried to publish on npm registry first. Github showed that the package is published
                and even downloaded once(???? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), but I cannot find it anywhere on my npm account. I managed to npm install the package with the repo name.
                Then I found that, at least in <code>.elm</code>files, Elm does not allow importing the external modules that are not published in Elm packages. (actually, I'm not sure
                if it is actively disallowed or just a use case so rare that I could not find any info). I followed a blog to publish to Elm packages, which was a quite smooth experience 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I'd look into <code>git tag</code> in details later, maybe as part of a git workshop.
                I should make some time to learn Vim as I have a hard time with it at every merge, apparently it's a powerful tool.
                As I plan to learn about aliases and windowing tools as well, maybe I'll make a grand workshop for all three topics.
                "just so that you can focus on the actual code without silly bothers" workshop.

            <p> Friday afternoon, I finished part 2 of Go workshop. I'm not so sure about the data structure I have. The tests are passing and I have used the mentioned packages, 
                which is an alright start. That Go programming books is so full of facts, fact after fact inside every single paragraph...

                Aspirations: I want to do some real low-level stuff with Go

                I really need to style these html files a bit....
