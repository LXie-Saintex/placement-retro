            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: BFF, Lockfiles</p>
            <p>The least busy week I'd had since September. I picked up the refined ticket on Thursday and did not finish it before the week ends</p>
            <p>
                Pass Knowledge Module exam; went to some refinement sessions to see how the discussions about Savers' future pan out; 
                started on collecting evidence for Employer Reference too. I sent Craig 6 mails and Jem 4, some of which overlaps regarding standard points.</p>
            <p>
                Finished writing the section on team introduction for the Savers' project; The original plan was to combine all the tasks I did at Savers into 
                1 mega-project so that I write the team intro only once ðŸ˜ƒ. This includes a frontend task with React Native and Storybook, which I had had extensive
                discussions over with my colleagues; and 2 related backend tasks that manages AWS resources with Shell scripts; Altogether, they should cover the standard points
                to do with: UI, Maths, Best Practices, Influence, Deployment, SDLC, Complexity etc. </p>
            <p>
                The problem is that I'm only writing the 1st task and the project is already 15 pages long. 
                I want to submit the Savers' project by the end of next week so that I can get confirmation about which points were covered. also I want to avoid repeating the team intro 
                across projects, so I'd need to cram the 2 backend tickets and get the project submitted by the end of next week. It will be a big project consists of 2/3 of diagrams & illustrations and 1/3 of actual writing. It should be easy to review albeit being a mega0project ðŸŒš. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Next week is my semi-final sprint for the apprenticeship. I just need to: 
                <ul>
                    <li>finish collecting evidence for Employer Reference for MAIN & Savers</li>
                    <li>finish my last task at Savers</li>
                    <li>finish writing the Savers project(this is the only part that might cause me a burnout)</li>
                    <li>submitting & receiving feedback for the 2nd rotation</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Once I'd done the above, I will have no more new tasks at work this year, unless Functional Skills exam became available. Until the apprenticeship ends, 
                Portfolio writing & revising will be Business As Usual(BAU); the same goes for Employer Reference, which can be done quickly as long as
                there's existing writeup beforehand. As I do weekly journal and portfolio writing, it shouldn't take much effort at all. New materials for portfolio writing 
                will be collected as I go to the 3rd rotation. Don't need to worry about synoptic project yet as its structure & content will probably be determined by
                the standard points coverage. 
            </p>
            <p>^^ This means that I can do <a href="todos.html">my side projects</a> again when I get to the 3rd rotation. WOOHOO </p>
            <p>I should do a yearly review of my first year at work. </p>
            <b>Second thought: I need to do a special project for the semi-final sprint. Given my latest obsession over True History of Kelly Gang, 
                I'll name it Wangaratta. </b>
