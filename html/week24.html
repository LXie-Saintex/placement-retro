            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: BFF, Lockfiles</p>
            <p>The most chill week I've had since September, i needed this. I picked up the refined ticket on Thursday and did not finish it before the week ends</p>
            <p>Pass Knowledge Module exam; went to some refinement sessions to see how the discussions about Savers' future pan out. </p>
            <p>Finished writing the section on team introduction for the Savers' project; I will finish writing and submit the frontend task next week. 
                The original plan was to include all the tickes that I have done at Savers as a big project, but I already have 15 pages at the first task section.
                Makers have not given any feedback on the MAIN project after 2 weeks so I guess they don't need to review a even bigger piece of writing.
