                Things I enjoyed most this week: Product Switch page styling
            </p>
            <p>
                I had worked on wwp-139 all week and my code will go into release next Monday if everything turns out alright. It's so nice 
                to have worked on somthing that has value (for Rupert Murdoc at least). I spent 2 days on running the old MAIN platform's Java
                microservices which had been quite a magical mystery tour. it was mellow but can't really say I learnt something from it. Not until
                Thursday was I told the priority is to add the stylings. I spent all day to add plain css to plain HTML, which was surprisingly rewarding
                as it was real work that goes into production quickly. Had some difficulties with the positioning of the header image as the browsers cut it off
                for reasons still unknown to me. I combined absolute and relative positioning to fix this issue and the end result was pretty good as the 
                styling behaviour is almost identical across browsers, devices and layout modes. 
            </p>

                This is the end of the rotation and the placement retro. I imagined a long review at this point but nothing comes up to me as worth reviewing. 
                I know exactly what I did and what I could have done better. Next week I'll be joining MAIN as a permanent dev, i'm so excited about the incoming
                learning. To be baffled, overwhelmed, shaken and grow with great difficulties in public; these are the things I had always wished for myself. 
                In this sense, MAIN is my biggest present so far. I'll take it in and grind it down.
