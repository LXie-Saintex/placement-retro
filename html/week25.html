            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: portfolio writing on Savers project</p>
            <p>
                This week was my last week at Savers. I finished the ticket on Tuesday and then had been working on the apprenticeship stuff.
                For the details, see the named special <a href="./wangaratta.html">wangaratta</a>.

                The work on the apprenticeship can be paused for now. I submitted the Savers project but it has been bounced by Makers because they 
                hadn't get to review the first piece yet. I reckon the work will be resumed once I'm half way through the 3rd rotation. This means I could
                focus in coding and learning new skills for at least a month, which is fantastic news.

                Michelle sent over the docs about synoptic projects, will look at it maybe next year. Some points are not covered by the projects so need to be
                demonstrated by portfolio evidence instead. will watch out for that once I got feedback on the first piece of evidence.
