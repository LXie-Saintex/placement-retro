            <p>What I enjoyed most this week: SSH keys</p>
            <p>
                First week at Sun Savers. I haven't finished setting up the environment for mobile development (ios, android).
                Got the app running on the web okay on Wednesday and created a PR to modifiy the README. It has been approved but not merged
                mostly because of the inefficiency of CI pipelines. It took an average of 40 mins to run the suite. When all checks have passed, 
                the master branch often have been updated. It means I need to rebase and go through the whole process again and again.
                The jobs in the pipelins often fail due to time out, rather than logic (when rerun it passes), which prolong the process even longer. 
                I think this is an area that desperately needs some improvement.
                It is frustrating in that the tests results are indeterminate and it simply takes too long to get feedback.

                Started to work on a ticket from Thursday. I should complete it next Monday. My task is to add component to storybook,
                which is a tool allows you to develop reusable UI components in an isolated environment. What interests me most were snapshot testing and knobs, 
                I'll find out how they are implemented. It makes me a little happier because I'm a huge fan of tools.üîßü™ì‚öíÔ∏èüñå‚õì‚öôÔ∏è

                Didn't work on vendor qualification. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was good to talk to other dev in the team and know their interests. Through conversations I found out stuff about myself that I did not know.  
                I don't mind if I worked on something that takes up no space on the UI. I prefer to build more permanent things that can be reused 
                and widely applicable. The problem atm is that there isn't enough time. I've only just started and my knowledge is superficial. 
                I find myself piling up an impossible amount of daily tasks simply because I want to know more about everything. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps a scheme of task reshuffling would help. I'll keep jotting down things to look into and do as many as I can during the week. On the weekends, I can 
                review the unfinished tasks and find out the overlapping aspects. 
                Based on that, I could come up with a weekend project that produces actual value (in one way or the other). 
                It will help me greatly with abstract thinking and get much more done.
