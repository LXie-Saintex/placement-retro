            <p>What I enjoyed most this week: SSH keys</p>
            <p>
                First week at Sun Savers. I haven't finished setting up the environment for mobile development (ios, android).
                Got the app running on the web okay on Wednesday and created a PR to modify README. It has been approved but not merged
                , mostly due to the inefficiency of CI pipelines in my opinion. It took an average of 40 mins to run the suite. When all checks have passed, 
                the master branch often have been updated, which means I need to rebase and go through the whole process again.
                Also the jobs often fail due to time out rather than logical issues (when rerun it passes), which prolongs the process even longer. 
                It is frustrating in that the tests results are indeterminate and it simply takes too long to get feedback. I think this is an area that desperately needs improvement.

                Started to work on a ticket from Thursday. I should complete it next Monday. My task is to add component to storybook,
                which is a tool allows you to develop reusable UI components in an isolated environment. What interests me most were snapshot testing and knobs, 
                I'll find out how they are implemented. stuff like that makes me a little happier because I'm a huge fan of tools.üîßü™ì‚öíÔ∏èüñå‚õì‚öôÔ∏è

                Didn't work on vendor qualification. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was good to talk to other devs in the team and to know their interests. Through conversations I found out stuff about myself that I did not know.  
                For example, I don't mind if I worked on something that takes up no space on the UI. I prefer to build more permanent things that can be reused 
                and widely applicable. The problem atm is that there isn't enough time. I've only just started and my knowledge is very limited. I cannot build 
                permanent things with superficial understanding.
                I find myself piling up an impossible amount of daily tasks simply because I want to know more about everything. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps a scheme of task reshuffling would help. I'll keep jotting down things to look into and do as many as I can during the week. 
                ( Capitalists call it accumulation, I call it inertia. Not that you don't need it). 
                On the weekends, I can review the unfinished tasks and find the overlapping aspects. They will be the toolchain reference of a quick project, 
                which I can complete in 2 days. 
                It will help me greatly with abstract thinking and get much more done.
