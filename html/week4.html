            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: my first ticket, arrays and slices in go, deadlock </p>
            <p> 
               Got my first ticket this week üßöüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. 
            </p>
            <p> I worked on a cross-browser issue. The same decoder was alright in Chrome but failing in Firefox.
                I found the decoder that was failing, and discovered it uses a regular expression. I tested the regex 
                on jsfiddle in firefox, which threw a syntax error, but was fine in Chrome. I looked into it and found that
                Firefox does not yet support named capturing group. So I changed it to normal capturing group to finish my first ticket. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Solving the actual debug was not enough. When I triggered the CI pipeline on Gitlab, 
                Cypress tests were failing in need of a record key, which was visible only to master branch. 
                I first tried to add the key directly to the yaml file, which passes the test, but leaves security concerns.
                The variable was protected and exposed to only protected branches. so I changed the branch setting in order to access the variable.
