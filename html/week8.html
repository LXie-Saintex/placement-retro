            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: everything about Go</p>
            <p> 
              It's a very short work week. Finished Go workshop on Tuesday. 
            </p>

                Did the mock exam on Measureup, looks pretty simple. I plan to make some demos to practice the test-covered topics. 
                including: 
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS position, selectors, flexbox, transform, word-wrap, word-break</li>
                    <li>HTML canvas, form attributes, audio&video, web font</li>
                    <li>media queries, web storage, application cache, websocket</li>
                </ul>
                There are a few others I need to cover as well: 
                <ul>
                    <li>JS & jQuery JSON methods</li>
                    <li>JS error-handling</li>
                </ul>
                These should be covered pretty quickily, I plan to spend 2 days on these before taking another test on Measureup, 
                and see how things go
            </p>
            <p>
