            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: Type system, DOM, CSSOM and performance. </p>
            <p> We had a very smooth introduction in my opinion. 
                Craig asked about our preferences and listed out what we are looking to learn in the next 3 months.
                I said that I am more drawn to backend because I expect that there is more to learn in backend. 
            </p>
            <p> The daily tasks were interesting. 
                Prior to this week, I did not have any knowledge of CI/CD, Kubernetes, Type system , Tokenisation & AST, and CSSOM. 
                Everyday we read about the new topics, sometimes we prepare demos for demonstration. 
                Then at the end-of-day catchup, we explain what they are, how do they work and why do we need them. 
                For me, the hardest part was to understand the CI/CD process and Kubernetes. There are many introductory
                articles on those topics that give very similar explanations, and I found myself memorizing rather than 
                understanding them. I might be able to explain CI/CD and Kubernetes only when I've started to use them.
            </p> 
            <p> Reading about type system, tokenisation and AST was fun. It helped me understood <em>compiling</em> a lot better. I'd like to use
                tools like Uglifier / terser to learn more about AST.
