                Completed my second ticket in SQUAD 2. It was to create a lambda function that fetched data from the tables and parse them into
                a csv file. Didn't get to see what I've done on AWS in the end because there was a small time format issue.
                The actual work involved a lot of copy and pasting the existing patterns of other functions. 
                Again I spent most time looking at other people's code and changing parts for my own use.

                Most days I felt satisfied because I've been assigning to myself CS topics to research. I've also insisted on figuring things out 
                by myself ( If I'm not learning loads of new stuff, this is the best I can do ) when I'm not crazy tired.
                But by the end of the week (when I'm writing this retro now), I can give only a very short list after looking through the repos I've contributed to. 
                I had to look at the commit messages to remind myself what I've done.

                It was challenging at times but nothing left an impression on me. I think the only answer is to be more alert at work, and to spend more time 
                on my personal project. Basically jot down anything that I can't give an answer for and research later. Found some projects of Craig's on Github, 
                they can be my next tutorials.

                This week I spent a lot of time in engineers beginners' club to prepare for the presentation. Practiced my part and 
                drive this week's meeting and made a diagram for the slide.

                Off to Sun Savers next week, some admin work to do. Need to give Jem a briefing on this rotation (my tasks and my goals) to make sure things are not 
                a huge blur by the end of the next 3 months.
