            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: JS arrow functions, thunk and closures, Well known symbols 
                and TDD custom JS higher order functions </p>
            <p> I encountered a series of brand new concepts again this week. 
            </p>
            <p> Test-Drive was fun. It was good to have a general overview of the available JS testing tools and their pros and cons. 
                I chose Ava in the end for the custom implementations of map, filter and reduce. It is very fast and has a clean and minimal look. 
                In the docs, it's said that Ava can run multiple tests at the same time. I'm not sure what advantages does that give me. 
                I didn't consider Mocha because I don't see the point of flooding a simple test suite with plugins. 
                I combined Ava with Sinon and Node.js assert library for the tests. It was the first time that I used
                seperate tools for writing tests, asserting and spying. Next I'd like to look into Tape, from which Ava borrowed heavily.
            </p> 
            <p> More functional programming concepts this week! I like how lazy evaluation allows for more control of the program. 
                There is more deliberative planning and less unexpected results. 
            </p>
            <p> I was glad to find JS Arrow functions among the daily tasks after the quirky behaviour of <code>this</code> during TDD. </p>
            <p> Well known symbols seem to be useful. I enjoyed writing custom iterators, though they didn't work as expected.</p>
            <p> I started building a new web app in Elm nearing the end of this week. I had built two Elm apps before, one is a rock,paper, scissors game,
                and the other gives you the current weather in London.This time I used Merriam-Webster API to build a dictionary app where you search for a word, 
                and it gives you either the definition or some alternative words. I was quite familiar with the http package so it didn't take me
                long to display something onto the screen. But it did take me some time to construct a url based on user inputs. 
                The part of capturing inputs is straightforward. What I found baffling was that the evoked events cannot pass data to each other in Elm.
                I was slightly lost when I realize that I cannot resort to global variables either as when coding in Javascript. In the end, I added that piece of info
                to the model, which is available throughout the program. I was rather reluctant to do so because I thought of model as, well, where models gather. 
                I didn't think it's sensible for the model to hold client-generated values.
            </p>
            <p> 
               The part that I struggled most with was the JSON decoders. I found it hard to read the type signature of union tagged types. 
               I don't know if it's for the purpose of accommodating a variety of use cases, but the docs' explaination of the methods seemed rather vague to me.
