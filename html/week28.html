            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: Permission Centre</p>
            <p>
                Finished WWP-140 on Thursday. I learnt to use Abstract and run the gdpr project locally. Also learnt how react-toggle and react-helmet work.
                Ticket is not yet merged as i am waiting on the business's response regarding the design conflicts. We had a discussion on React libraries on Monday. 
                Didn't really come to a conclusion except that we are going to look into RxJS, redux and its plugins. I can't imagine how the code changes when using 
                different tools to be honest. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Still not quite sure what the products are in Wireless. By the look of it, i don't think the other devs have a clue either.
                i can draw some diagrams on the architecture and the products based on my own understanding, and then show it to the team 
                and let the team make corrections. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Audio Platform seems disconnected from the other Wireless software developement teams. Their capabilities are used by more than other Wireless
                projects and i wonder if they can be considered as a SaaS/PaaS. I wonder how does News UK orchestrate the platform and the title teams. 
                I can draw some diagrams or do some writeups on this and ask Jeremy & Craig for feedback. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another writeup/drawing I plan to do  is on Permission Centre. Craig gave me his writing on this and I look into it a bit more on Monday. This has opened up a few more 
                newsuk areas for me, such as Data Platforms and Campaigns. Permission Centre itself is a telling result of NewsUK Technoloy department in general.
                It can done along with the above research on Platform & Title teams. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Didn't work on Friday because i found a mouse in the flat so I was doing pest control and moving out temporarily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Got the feedback on my portfolio. It's largely positive and says I can cover the scope that I requested as long as I cut down on
                the writing and focus more on showcasing. I will get it resubmitted next week.
