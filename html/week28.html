            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: Permission Centre</p>
            <p>
                Finished WWP-140 on Thursday. I learnt to use Abstract and run the gdpr project locally. Ticket is not yet merged as i am waiting
                on the business's response regarding the designs. 
            </p>

                Still not quite sure what the products are in Wireless. By the look of it, i don't think the other devs have a clue either.
                i need to draw some diagrams on the architecture and the products. Probably with the help of a Product Overview and the colleagues.
                Audio Platform seems disconnected from the other Wireless software developement teams. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I plan to write a "Permission Centre" narrative on Wireless's Confluence page. I spent a lot of time speaking to people in MAIN to
                find out more about the project. Craig gave me his writing on this. Will look into it a bit more on Monday. This has opened up a few more 
                newsuk areas for me, such as Data Platforms and Campaigns. Permission Centre seems a result of telling circumstances. Something for me to read
                on for the next two weeks
            
            </p>
            <p>
                Didn't work on Friday because i found a mouse in the flat so I was doing pest control and moving out temporarily.
            </p>

                Got the feedback on my portfolio. It's largely positive and says I can cover the scope that I requested as long as I cut down on
                the writing and focus more on showcasing. I will get it resubmitted next week.
