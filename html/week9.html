            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: CAP theorem</p>
            <p> 
              another short week. Started building a Go backend on Wednesday. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                was asked to choose a Go web framework. I didn't know what kinda works this backend should handle, so I chose the simplest
                httprouter, and expected to add other frameworks as the objectives and tasks become clearer. Craig
                said initially it should just be a headless API and later it can be developed into a full stack app that serve files. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On Thursday, I started a new repo for the backend. I decided to TDD this project (and probably every single project I'll be doing 
                for the rest of my life). There was some confusion about package and modules when I tried to test the <code>main()</code> function. 
                It seemed that the main package cannot be imported for testing. I put the functions to be tested in a separate package, and read 
                about the Go modules blog to get the import paths right. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Took some time to think about what to test in a http api and figure out how to use the adapters as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of Thursday, I had a server listening on port 8080 and the router&handler was working fine. 
                The test was off. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Found out the problem with the test on Friday. I need to set up a test context with a framework. Will use gin-gonic, which also built on httprouter.
            </p>

                Spent some time reading about standard streams
