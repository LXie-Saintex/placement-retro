            <p>
                Probably the least productive days I've had in 2020
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd say the time I spent on actual coding was about a day. But this one day effort has been so painfully bad that I 
                am doing a writeup just to clear my mind up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When the long weekend started, my plan was to get the backend up and running, and perhaps look into the ticket a little. 
                I thought this goal realistic and didn't mind doing work stuff outside work hours, because I'd learn about 
                Java applications and Kubernetes. In the end, I didn't touch on Kubernetes at all, instead I had spent all hours on running the Java apps. 
            </p>
            <p>
                First day, 4 hours effort. I knew what I need to research from the beginning. From the file structure, I can see they use spring framework, 
                gradle and maven. I looked into it because on sunsavers doc, it says I need to build and run the applications before I can use flyway to 
                fill up the schemas. I decided to figure out the commands for "build and run" on my own. By the end of the day, I had a JAR file built but execution throws an error
            </p>
            <p>
                Second day, 0 hours 
            </p>
            <p>
                Third day, 3 hours effort. So why is it not running. I looked at the error messages. <code>FILE_LOG_PATTERN_IS_UNDEFINED</code> and some aws beans instantiation
                errors. I thought that in order to understand the dependencies errors, I need to know how gradle wires up dependencies and where lies the configuration files.
                After reading about gradle build script I decided to start my own gradle project (<a href="https://github.com/lxierita/gradling">https://github.com/lxierita/gradling</a>)
                , and add the mentioned frameworks/tools gradually. I added spring and learnt how <code>buildscript</code> works. I have not looked into the concept, 
                "Maven / IVY- compatible repositories or filesystem". It sounds very bare metal to me because repos and filesystems do not sound like techonologies. But I remembered that 
                Docker and its storage driver, which is something I should definitely get back to. Now that this is happening, I'll do a comparison between Maven/Ivy and Docker filesystems.
                Since I have no idea what they are at this point, I only hope that there are some commonalities or relations between the two ðŸ˜‚. (relations as in, 
                one doesn't do something good enough, so the other came about. Or, one is a complementary to the other due to platform or other restrictions)
                I learnt how to list gradle tasks and use <code>:bootRun</code> to start a Java application. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fourth day, 0 hours
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time of writing, I had had help from Petar who says the error I'm getting just requires some environment variables set up. There are now a lot of 
                envs in my <code>~/.zshrc</code>. I cannot run the apps without them but most of them do not even have meaningful values. 
                Is it inevitable to have such chaotic configuration when using these tools? or did they just do it wrong?
            </p>
            <p>
                Going back the purpose of this writing. I was feeling very doubtful as the solutions to my problems are often non-solutions, but instead are requirements/prerequisites. 
                It's frustrating because I had problem-solving in mind when started researching. When I failed to provide the solution, it becomes very real that what I've found through research
                are very superficial. I could start a side project to carry out further learning, but it would be a project without explicit goals because I don't know what the application should look like. 
                It's definitely wrong to do a structured learning project this time there's not much guidance available. I can still use the new gradle repo as a playground though. 
                I can make sure that I understood every single line of code in that repo and so make it a convenient testing tool.

                Tips for self 
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask for answers if too many moving parts (reversed learning afterwards)</li>
                    <li>repo as a testing tool is a good idea</li>
                </ul>
