                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <article>
                    <p>I spent half a day on this project (sober morning, drunken afternoon). All I can say is that there were a lot of
                        dependencies issues. First it was the typescript template I try to use and then it was cocoapods dependencies. My knowledge of
                        installing on file system is zero. I have no idea how to check where the executables and envs are installed, and how does the computer 
                        decide which one to use when mulitple versions available. I decided the day is too short for me to dive into a topic that seems rather complicated
                        and broad. So I looked up SunSavers repo and found out that they used a Gemfile to download cocoapods at runtime. I copied the files and had no more building problem.
                    </p> 
                    <p>Writing react native code was the easy part, I spent 10 mins reading on RN's official intro to native components and then started writing straight away. 
                        I was not interested in content but just wanted to check if everything is fine, and it was. Way into the afternoon, I found out my original plan 
                        was to get it running on Web as well. I downloaded react-native-web then and needed to set up aliases in the module bundler config, in order to 
                        load react-native-web when I import react-native in files. I used Metro, which was shipped with RN. Looked up the doc and I could not really find 
                        anything similar to the alias resolver in other module bundlers. So I started to look up webpack's source files, and wanted to find out how is alias resolution implemented. 
                        Craig found the file for me but I'm not sure that file actually helped me. I will get back to this some time later this weekend (perhaps).
                    </p>
                    <p>In general, I'm happy with the half-day effort. I learnt that RN translates the code to native languages at runtime. I now know that you need a server running to start the app. 
                        Sounds obvious I know, but who the fuck knows what the command is doing when it's called <code>start</code> or <code>run</code>. I did't get to configure 
                        Gradle because I didn't get that far. I learnt that ios app manages its dependencies through pods.

                <h3>Project 2: Back to backend with: Go, Docker and cube problem</h3>
                <p>Purpose: to not forget about what I've learnt when in MAIN; do some problem solving with code</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>‚úÖ app can be built and run with Dockerfile</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>‚ùå app speaks to database in a container</li>
                        <li>‚ùå app uploads assets to a AWS S3 bucket</li>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        I learnt that there's something called storage driver that lets you store things outside the containers. 
                        If you wanted your files generated in the containers to persist, you'd need them. I looked into it 
                        in the first place is because I want to see why my Dockerfile is failing image build. I heard somewhere about 
                        "ssh into" and thought that's what I needed. But it's only useful when the image is already built successfully. 
                        In the same way, I learnt that you can open a bash in a running container and interact with it. I read about the Union
                        file system that docker uses, not sure that I understood much though. The writable layer sounds very useful, i should get back to that 
                        and checkout what other types of file systems there are. In the end, I still don't know what happened to the intermediate
                        images when the image build fails. Now that Docker is using Hyperkit instead of VirtualBox, are there any folders somewhere on my machine
                        that contains the layers info. I'd like to know more about the differences between Hyperkit and VirtualBox as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Didn't get to do some algorithm practice. Got back touch with Go by writing a function that generates a text file to store the results.
                        That was fun.

            <h3>Big Summary</h3>
            <p>I am not realistic when setting plans, which probably makes me end up doing less because I never wanted more even before I start</p>
            <p>Main reason behind that is probably because there's simply too much to learn, so I want to cover everything</p>
            <p>Make compromises to set achievable goals next time. </p>
