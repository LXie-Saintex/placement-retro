            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: service workers, http/2, elm-syntax </p>
            <p> 
               Been working on two tickets this week. 
            </p>
            <p> One is to do with writing a linting rule with a open source library. It was fun to use library to build tools that help the project. 
                 Not sure how similar the AST of elm-syntax is to other ASTs, but I am liking the idea of learning more about it. Elm-review had a rather
                 small community, so I mostly got help from the major contributors of that library. They suggested that I should publish the rule once it's done, either integrate
                 into the main one or under my own name. On Friday, I started writing the docs and README.md as well as 
                 configuring <code>elm.json</code> so as to make it a publishable package.
            </p>
            <p> The other ticket is to do with error handling. It was easy to write more detailed error messages since there was already a <code>HttpHelper</code> file.
                What took time was to find a way recover from the errored state. I found it a bit hard to locate which part was causing the problem, because
                almost all functions modified the state one way or the other. Luckily the naming was expressive enough for me to narrow the search. 
                It's clear to me now how important naming is for maintaining a large project or legacy code. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I should make a PWA to practice the concepts I read about this week.
