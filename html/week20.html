            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: exponential backoff, what does MAIN do</p>
            <p>
                Started to work on terraform cleanup since Monday. It's largely similar to the previous task just with different commands.
                The error-handling is slighly more intricate, which was fun for me as I got to learn about exponential backoff. I'm particularly
                happy with <a href="https://github.com/newsuk/sun-savers-services-core-build/pull/37/files#diff-588d95cc931853ba62fb4b13eab6375aR15-R34">how I implemented it</a>,
                but probably will never find out if it works, unless I set up a database and inserts records like a maniac and then batch delete them.
                I find that if I started the task with a structure in mind, that is, think about the exact steps to take and the results & errors to expect,
                refactoring comes naturally and sometimes so explicit, almost in the form of an error, that it moves me as a person...

                JS learning was good. I learnt about the prototype chain a long time ago and registered nothing back then. The MDN docs make more sense when I look at it now,
                as I understand the particulars a bit better, for example, why and when do I want to reassign the constructor to the child after inheriting the prototype methods from the parent.
                As I get more familiar with Javascript, I find myself starting to appreciate it as an existence that has its own characteristics and ways of reasoning.

                Writing the portfolio gave me the chance to look at MAIN's architecture and the business context. I didn't do that while in MAIN because the time was short and I was
                focusing on completing the tasks. Business context is not as mind-numbing as I thought, I don't mind exploring any field of knowledge as long as it's well-regimented and open.
