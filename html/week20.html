            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: exponential backoff, what does MAIN do</p>
            <p>
                Started to work on terraform cleanup since Monday. It's largely similar to the previous task just with different commands.
                The error-handling is slighly more intricate, which was fun for me as I got to learn about exponential backoff. I'm particularly
                happy with <a href="https://github.com/newsuk/sun-savers-services-core-build/pull/37/files#diff-588d95cc931853ba62fb4b13eab6375aR15-R34">how I implemented it</a>,
                but probably will never find out if it works (unless I set up a database and inserts records like maniac and then batch delete them). 
                I find that if I started the task with a structure in mind (as in, the exact steps to be taken and the results and errors to be expected),
                the refactoring comes naturally and sometimes so explicit(as an error) that it moves me with its beauty ðŸ˜…. 
            </p>
            <p>
                JS learning was good. I learnt about the prototype chain a long time ago and pretty sure nothing registered. The MDN docs make more sense when I look at it now,
                and I could understand the intricates a bit better, such as reassigning the constructor to the child after inheritng the prototype methods from the parent.
                I find myself starting to appreciate Javascript as an entity(that has its own characteristics and ways of reasoning) as I'm getting more familiar with it.
            </p>

                Writing the portfolio gave me a great change to look at MAIN's architecture and the business context. I don't mind exploring any field of knowledge as long as it's well-regimented and open.
                My cynicism surfaces when a field has become self-obsessive and start to set high barriers for outsiders and make it difficult to onboard.
