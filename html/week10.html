            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: Docker, CORS, Excalidraw</p>

              Had a day off on Tuesday because unwell

                Elm front-end can now be run from a docker container. The test I'd been working on since last week 
                turns out to be useless because it is too low-level. I was told it's an easy mistake to make when TDD and I 
                need to find the right balance and to make testing decisions between behaviours and implementations.
