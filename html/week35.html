                Things I enjoyed most this week: CI setup
            </p>
            <p>
                CI is set up fine. the config is validated and the environment variables are set in the Project setting. From now on, we can use any images
                available in <code>ncu-circleci-pipelines</code>. The tests are failing though because the script commands are not valid, which can be fixed in a separate PR.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team agreed to work on organising the wider channel during retro on Friday, so I expect some progress to be made on that next week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Settled on the date to join MAIN. I have 1 more sprint at Wireless before going back to MAIN Squad 2 on the 1st of Feb.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had been reviewing PRs late and it's pretty bad. Will start the workday with checking for PR from now on. It didn't help when the PRs are huge 
                and proposed changes overlapped. The priority on Friday was to get WWP-401 done. I had put forward the summary on the current PR state but have received
                no comments. It is possible that the PR would be carried over to the next sprint if it continues to be neglected as I've been given no reasons to withdraw
                the change requests. The other PR WWP-411 was to be deployed despite of unresolved comments, which is partly my fault as I reviewed it quite late.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I felt that I had been pushy regarding the PR review process and a tad annoyed that the comments are not addressed properly before being resolved.
                I think I pissed off one of my colleagues too. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Had a call with Craig and he pointed out that I was more anxious than before. I also said how confused I have been. I am getting more and more signals that 
                things had not been well with me. I practically stopped learning the fundamentals and had spent a lot of time on self care. I think I took the necessary time off
                and I probably need a little cry after all this. Oh boy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Otherwise, things are going pretty well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Portfolio</b>: my evidence was bounced due to the new procedure introduced. I have resubmitted it.

            <p>
                <b>Employer reference</b>: MAIN and Wireless parts are done. Now just need to wait for the Savers part before I review it to see what is missing.

                <b>Maths exam</b>:I didn't work on it this week. Will take an initial assessment by the end of the day just to get a revision plan started.

            <p>
