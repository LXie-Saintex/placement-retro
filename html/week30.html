            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: Savers rewrite</p>
            <p>
                WWP-140 is yet unmerged because I couldn't get the "right" comparison to come up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What a week, i can't even remember what did I do. I did not finish Savers writeup as planned and neither have I merged 
                the only meaningful ticket I'd done since in Wireless. What is happening? 
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't pick up anything from the current sprint until Wednesday, which is a task that I still cannot work on. The reason
                I ignored other tasks is because I can't tell what to do from the ticket descriptions, i don't know which repo does it involve,
                who is maintaining it, or even what language is used. My solution to was to learn about the code-to-product of each product, which has been
                painstaking as the process was filled with distractions from other repos, the WWP ceremonies and the sprint work itself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been getting up late this week and in only 3 mornings I did things before work. I thought I could rest a little longer as nothing urgent at 
                the moment, and this is what went wrong because nothing is ever urgent. As I cut down a little of the effort spent on each task, the end result become
                a collection of unaccomplished. So far, I multi-tasked and delivered nothing. A reflection is necessary here. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                What did I want
            </h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to finish 70% the apprenticeship work by the end of the rotation <br> 
                I wanted to have a thorough understanding of how Wireless work <br>
                I wanted to contribute to the team fully both by sharing the workload & introducing better practices that are beneficial in the long run <br>
                I wanted to learn about Web development in depth through sprintwork <br>
                I wanted to see how my colleagues work and learn from them<br>
                I wanted to improve my multi-tasking and communication abilities <br>
                I wanted to improve my programming abilities <br>
            </p>
            
            <h3>What is the current situation - Halfway through my Wireless rotation</h3>
            <p>
                I have finished 30% of the apprenticeship work: MAIN rewrite completed; Savers rewrite half-finished. <br>
                <pre>
                    I have some understanding of Wirless but I cannot give a whole account of either the product or the archictecture. 
                        - Audio Platforms uses Omny & Pluxbox; APIs communicate with 3rd party (fetch & sync)
                        - Virgin Radio web app is in wd-virgin
                        - Profil-web is the webview of the mobile apps
                        - GDPR is the permission preferences webview of the apps
                        - TalkSPORT web app is in wd-drupal
                        - Auth0 is deployed for authentication 
                </pre><br>
                <pre>
                    I have not shared the workload to a noticeable degree
                        - 2 manual testing tickets blocked 
                        - 1 ticket lays down the groundwork for a product that will not be released when I have left the team.
                        - 1 took 3 days to complete but 3 weeks to be delivered, and still not released at the time of writing.
                </pre><br>
                <pre>
                    I have worked to introducing the best practices 
                        - I created task for better visibility of the development process: Github Integration for slack; brought up development panel
                        - I focus on keeping the code readable and maintainable when reviewing PR
                </pre><br>
                I have been exposed to and worked with React ecosystem and CSS-in-JS in a practical way but lack a high-level perspective. <br>
                I have had difficulty working with Git and have not set up my workflow smoothly. <br>
                I have learned parts and bits from my colleagues but nothing memorable. <br>
                I have been multi-tasking but so far I have not wrapped up a single one and my health has been affected. <br>
                I have been active in the refinement sesssions. <br>
                I have programmed once during for 1 hour in Go. <br>
                I have looked at the NewsUK technology structure from a business platforms & product teams perspective.
            </p>
            <h3>How did I get here</h3>
            <p>
                I separate my days into periods that are dedicated to different type of work, including sprint, admin, apprenticeship and wider learning <br>
                I spent a lot of time reviewing PRs and understanding the c2p simultaneously, which was often interrupted by meetings and slack messages <br>
                I put off the apprenticeship work without a plan <br>
                I have not kept up with the post-work learning <br>
                I have slacked off on the daily fundamentals learning <br>
                I lost my excalidraw notes <br>
                I put everything on excalidraw including drafts, agendas and reminders <br>
             </p>
             <h3>What's the problem</h3>
             <p>
                I have slacked off; I have been easily distracted throughout the day; i have not had enough experience to work quickly
             </p>
             <h3>What's the solution</h3>
             <p>
                Meet the deadlines & follow the plans <br>
                Prioritise wider learning over quick delivery as muscle memory does not come in 3 months <br>
                Contribute through the knowledge that I have (writing docs, other teams' best practices) <br>
                Communicate on what I don't have with the right person; collecting information from various sources through quick Q&A <br>
                Contribute back once finished communicating <br>
                Compromise and cut down on the amount of tasks accordingly <br>
                Be much less sedentary
