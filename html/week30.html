            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: Savers rewrite</p>
            <p>
                WWP-140 is yet unmerged because I couldn't get the "right" comparison to come up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What a week, i can't even remember what did I do. I did not finish Savers writeup as planned and neither have I merged 
                the only meaningful ticket I'd done since in Wireless. What is happening? 
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't pick up anything from the current sprint until Wednesday, which is a task that I still cannot work on. The reason
                I ignored other tasks is because I can't tell what to do from the ticket descriptions, i don't know which repo does it involve,
                who is maintaining it, or even what language is used. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been getting up late this week and only spent 3 mornings doing things before work. That's contributed to "doing less and less" too
