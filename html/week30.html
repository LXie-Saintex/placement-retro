            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: Savers rewrite</p>
            <p>
                WWP-140 has traumatised me as a dev. I worked on this for 3 days, and it's still on the board after 3 weeks. At first it was because of lack of reviews, 
                then it was the design update and finally I couldn't get the "right" comparison to come up when merge into Simeon's WWP-141. This is made further annoying when
                I couldn't run the project locally at one point. In the end, instead of fixing up the branches, I agreed that Simeon give a ill-defined dodgy-looking PR to
                the MAIN dev for automation test üôÅ, which I deeply regreted. I never wanted to to get it over with and so should have taken my stance to
                either further delay the test or at least settle for a well-documented PR. I will ask about the state of the PR on Monday, and this time I will not
                leave the decision to the other devs.
            </p>
            <p>
                What a week, i can't even remember what did I do. I did not finish Savers writeup as planned and neither have I merged 
                the only meaningful ticket I'd done since in Wireless. I am quite unhappy with myself this week. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't pick up anything from the current sprint until Wednesday, which is a task that I haven't started on. The reason
                I ignored other sprint items is because I can't tell what to do from the ticket descriptions, i don't know which repo does it involve,
                who is maintaining it, or even what language is used. My solution to was to learn about the code-to-product of each product, which has been
                painstaking as I was frequently distracted by other repos, the WWP ceremonies and the sprint work itself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been getting up late this week and in only 3 mornings I did things before work. I thought I could rest a little longer as nothing urgent at 
                the moment, and this is what went wrong because nothing is ever urgent. As I cut down a little of the effort spent on each task, the end result become
                a collection of unaccomplished. So far, I multi-tasked and delivered nothing. A reflection is necessary here. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                What did I want
            </h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to finish 70% the apprenticeship work before my holiday begins <br> 
                I wanted to have a thorough understanding of how Wireless work <br>
                I wanted to contribute to the team fully both by sharing the workload & introducing better practices that are beneficial in the long run <br>
                I wanted to learn about Web development in depth through sprintwork <br>
                I wanted to see how my colleagues work and learn from them<br>
                I wanted to improve my multi-tasking and communication abilities <br>
                I wanted to improve my programming abilities <br>
            </p>
            
            <h3>What is the current situation - Halfway through my Wireless rotation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Now is one week from my holiday and I have finished 30% of the apprenticeship work: MAIN rewrite (30%) completed; Savers rewrite (25%) 1/4 finished; Wireless (25%) and Miscellaneous (20%) not yet started
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am not up to speed; I have some understanding of Wireless but I cannot give a whole account of either the product or the archictecture; 
                    <ul>
                        <li> - Audio Platforms uses Omny & Pluxbox; APIs communicate with 3rd party (fetch & sync)</li>
                        <li> - Virgin Radio web app is in wd-virgin</li>
                        <li> - Profile-web is the webview of the mobile apps</li>
                        <li> - GDPR is the permission preferences webview of the apps</li>
                        <li> - TalkSPORT web app is in wd-drupal</li>
                        <li> - Auth0 is deployed for authentication</li>
                    </ul>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have not shared the workload to a noticeable degree 
                    <ul>
                        <li> - 2 manual testing tickets blocked </li>
                        <li> - 1 ticket lays down the groundwork for a product that will not be released when I have left the team.</li>
                        <li> - 1 took 3 days to complete but 3 weeks to be delivered, and still not released at the time of writing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have worked to introducing the best practices 
                        <ul>
                            <li> - I created task for better visibility of the development process: Github Integration for slack; brought up development panel</li>
                            <li> - I focus on keeping the code readable and maintainable when reviewing PR</li>    
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I have been exposed to and worked with React ecosystem and CSS-in-JS in a practical way but lack a high-level perspective.</li>
                <li>I have had difficulty working with Git and have not set up my workflow smoothly.</li>
                <li>I have learned parts and bits from my colleagues but nothing memorable.</li>
                <li>I have been multi-tasking but so far I have not wrapped up a single one and my health has been affected.</li>
                <li>I have been active in the refinement sesssions.</li>
                <li>I have programmed once during for 1 hour in Go.</li>
                <li>I have looked at the NewsUK technology structure from a business platforms & product teams perspective.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How did I get here</h3>
            <p>
                I separate my days into periods that are dedicated to different type of work, including sprint, admin, apprenticeship and wider learning <br>
                I spent a lot of time reviewing PRs and understanding the c2p simultaneously, which was often interrupted by meetings and slack messages <br>
                I put off the apprenticeship work without a plan <br>
                I have not kept up with the post-work learning <br>
                I have slacked off on the daily fundamentals learning <br>
                I lost my excalidraw notes <br>
                I put everything on excalidraw including drafts, agendas and reminders <br>
            </p>
             <h3>What's the problem</h3>

                    <b>I have not had enough experience to work quickly</b>

             </ul>
