            <p> Things I enjoyed most this week: ports</p>
            <p> 
               Joined Squad 2 on Thursday.

               Finished off the elm-go-docker-myql project. Well sort of, there were some questions unanswered and problems unsolved.

                I've been feeling disoriented for the first two days in team. I also feel stressed about the work I'd need to do for the apprenticeship. 
                Not that I feel challenged but I'm terrified of the boredom awaits me. 
                Saw the jira board and attended standups and retros. a bit underwhelmed to be honest. it's like I suddenly <b>STOPPED</b> doing things. 
                I need to put more thoughts into this so that <b>TIME</b> is not wasted.

                One good thing is that I saw MAIN's api for the first time. CDNs also seems fun, but I was somehow lost without Craig's guidance on this.
            </p>
            <p>
                For productivity, I plan to spend the weekend to setup IDEs, windowing tools, aliases and learn VIM, as Craig suggested. 
            </p>

                Next week onwards, I'd spend much more time on apprenticeship since work stuff isn't much...

                This is an <b>EMERGENCY</b>, I need to set up a separate learning journal and set out tasks so that I do not <b>slow down</b>.
