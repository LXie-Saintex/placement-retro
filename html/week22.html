            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: kubernetes</p>
            <p>
                I've been blocked from completing the last task because permission is still denied. So I moved on to the next task whilst waiting for that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kubernetes and AWS services are so abstract to me. I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm still convinced that learning on the job is a good approach
                as self-started side projects would involve very superficial learning because the concepts themselves are not manifest through practice like that.
                My plan is to use more commands to gain some muscle memory first, and then find out what is missing. I've somehow become quite acquainted with terraform
                because of the previous 2 tickets. I can confidently explain terraform from a high level despite I can sense that I am missing something.
                But AWS services and K8s really are a challenge as if it's a foreign land where I don't speak the language. 
                As this foreign land is cloud engineering, maybe I need to familiarize myself with those basic concepts first. I think that AWS and K8s are the instances
                of those concepts. As instances they are highly abstract and seems out of thin air. All I understood is that cloud engineering is the answer to the 
                limitations of physical machines. I cannot directly bridge K8s with this pretext. I need some intermediate contexts.
