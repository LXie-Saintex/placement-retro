            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: Docker, Git rebase</p>
            <p>
                Had a four days week. I learnt Git rebase and understood Git flow. VIM is so good and makes the terminal a nice place to live in.

                I picked up WWP-322 on Tuesday and unassigned myself from it after 2 days. I found it difficult to work with NewsKit API
                without an example to follow. I spent the first day working "against" the existing code: aka the tool set up and NewsKit.
                I thought as a new project, we should make a good start by configuring everything properly, which will enable us to do things 
                a lot quicker later. The storybook version used was quite old and has poor performance and will likely prolongs the development
                process. Once I've swallowed that, I faced more difficulties when working directly on the component. I wasted 1 day to "not" using 
                NewsKit by building my version of the data flow. It was a bad idea as the purpose was to avoid doing that. When I tried to use NewsKit,
                I couldn't find any code examples, and the docs are written more from designers' POV rather than that of devs. The docs were not very helpful
                bascially.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided that I should stop working on it as the process will be very painful and not rewarding at all. Because the difficulties lie in using NewsKit, 
                which is not exactly a well designed system that will teach me the "proper" ways of Web Development. For my own benefits, I think I
                should always prioritise taking quality input over solving problems resulted from a series of bad decisions. The most important lesson here is 
                that as an inexperienced dev, I should carefully evaluate the task difficulty and my own limits before picking up a ticket, especailly in an open team like Wireless that has
                little gatekeeping. 
            </p>

                I finished half of the Savers rewrite before putting it off for WWP-322. I've moved to Stage 2 with my portfolio.

            <p>
                I'm most happy that I started to doing the fundamentals via Excalidraw again. Even thought I acheived nothing for the team this week, I don't feel like having wasted my time on pointless
                mental gymnastic because of the fundamentals. I'm always bothered when not learning on the job, which has occurred quite frequent since in Wireless. I've not been up to speed. The team allows 
                to do whatever and because of that, I have found myself ignorant of most sprint items. I realised that I have not yet enough knowledge to work independently without specific and well-defined
                guidelines, especailly in a non-standardised environment that lacks established, well-documented procedure. I learnt how important it is to keep things simple via good documentations and listen carefully
                when seeking help. It's easy to forget that I need to understand both how things could work apart from how I can/want to make it work.
