            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: Gradle, ES modules</p>
            <p>
                Merged my branch on Wednesday. <a href="https://github.com/newsuk/sun-savers-apps/pull/1534">https://github.com/newsuk/sun-savers-apps/pull/1534</a>
                I changed the components in the end so that the contact is clearer and no ugly hacks. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Wednesday I've been waiting for my next task, which still hasn't happened. So I spent time reading on 12-factor app and doing
                other research on some topic I encountered here and there. Preparing for VQ is actually not that bad, which really surprised me. 
                The resources recommended are actually fun and are in depth. Makes me think that whoever wrote the exams might be good developers but snobbish.
                Otherwise why are they so reluctant to raise the bar of the actual question. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I'm happy that Sun Savers is exposing me to totally different stuff. Mobile development is something I never touched upon even when learning on my own.
