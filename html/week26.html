            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: monorepo hoisting</p>
            <p>
                First week at Wireless. I joined the Web Platform (WWP). The team is moving out of the backend repo to be a standalone project.
                I learnt that Wireless business logic relies on MAIN services, a extensible middleware from NewsCorp called Reel, and its own backend team 
                Audio Platform, which hosts several APIs in a monorepo. Wireless also work with Content Platforms and Product Platforms extensively, especially
                with NewsKit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally I picked up 4 tickets. I combined WWP-138 into WWP-63, and create a new subtask WWP-210. I spent most time looking at 
                the EV flow in order to make the ticket scopes and inter-relation clear.
                On Friday, I started to create the new project locally for WWP-52. will have the tech lead review my set up next week and then decide what next, as I 
                don't have permission to create repos in the organisation Github account. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I contacted the reviewer Catherine about the feedback on my portfolio. I was arguing that I did meet certain requirements and she promised to move me to Stage 1
                once I resubmit. I resubmitted on Tuesday. 
            </p>

                asked Craig about the hiring process, he says he's not sure.
