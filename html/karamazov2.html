        <h1>Karamazovs 2</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
               This is a newer version of the Karamazovs Weeks. See project description there <a href="./karamazov.html">The Karamazovs Weeks</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                I ditched the original plan in the first week of <a href="./html">Ivan</a>. The design is not suitable for me as each period stays on a 
                particular exercise for too long. I feel anxious about other stuff not being done and get bored when the huge workload consists of the same things.
                Ivan v1 focuses entirely on non-linear learning where I do the writeups and drawups to explore News UK technology. The other major task - resubmit
                MAIN is a writeup that largely reviews and summarises and so opens up limited programming learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time of writing, the first Thursday of Ivan, I've spent 3 consecutive mornings on understanding my current team and company and 1 on 
                rewinding the Go basics. I did not do any programming exercise for the past 6 days and have made no educational mistakes that have left an impression on me.
                (if you exclude the project planning itself). I think I will feel the same once get to Dmitri where programming is the sole activity. By then I would
                feel that I'm not learning any business side of things and everything i jotted down during Ivan has to be relearnt. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence, MIX IT UP!
            </p>
            <p>
                Finishing apprenticeship is still the priority and i will not put it off. The other tasks will be present throughout different periods
                and alternated on a 2-day basis.
