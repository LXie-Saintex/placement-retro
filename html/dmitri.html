            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                I am enjoying the new workflow that I set up for Dmitri and will continue using it for <a href="./pavel.html">pavel</a>.
                I added a new side project to learn about web development, on which I spent around 3 days. Then I try to figure out 
                what confused me so much about Wireless, which also took about 3 days. I wouldn't say I got everything cleared up but at least
                I found the next improvement to be done. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I did nothing about algorithm & Go practicing, which was the theme of Dmitri. It makes me think that I'm getting afraid of actual coding
                due to lacking exercise. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also spent some time looking at Synoptic project & planning Pavel, which went quite well and I'm ready to step into the final stage of
                <a href="./karamazov.html">The Karamazov Weeks</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today is the final day of Dmitri, I am feeling scared of incoming work but I don't want to b nor can I stop here and turn away.
