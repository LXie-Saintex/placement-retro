            <p>Things I enjoyed most this week: JS spec and implementations</p>
            <p>
                Finished WWP-52 this week. left the backend-frontend communication undone because it'd be easier for the person writing component to do it.

                Didn't work on portfolio as planned. Haven't heard from Maker about the feedback on my first piece of evidence either.

                I spent most time in wider learning and then apply them to the task. There's a lot to project configuration
                as it's mainly decision-making and it requires certain breadth of knowledge to choose the right tools. 
                I'm happy to have picked this ticket up as it opened up a lot of topics for me to research. 
                I had to bear the time limitation in mind which prevents me from going down the rabbit hole. Next Monday is crammed with meetings because
                2 colleagues on leave the next day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Was supposed to start working on the next task on Friday but was unwell. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Something's off about the backlog tickets. the ticket scopes don't always make sense from the technical perspectives and 
                they are not shielded from the dependencies on the other team. It makes sprint planning and reporting less effective. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel like the WWP team has taken me as a proper, not a junior software engineer, which is really nice as I am pushed to 
                learn and contribute more and finish things in time. it's more challenging because i take responsibilities for what i am doing. 
                My time at MAIN was like the feeding stage where i just stuff my face (albeit with knowledge) and get fat. When at Savers, I started to see
                what the real work looks like, and now in Wireless i'm expected to own the work that i've done (not entirely still). of course, everything makes
                sense when you look at it chronologically. That's how time works, everything seems like progress as long as you ticked off some boxes along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                one thing i know for sure is that i'd need to start taking responsibilities for my code when back in MAIN. i'll get back to the feeding stage too, so it'd 
                be best if could start binge learning now. if there's some form of interview before final placement, i need to be ready for that. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <p><b>What do I need to know to be ready?</b></p>
                <p>Common tools& technologies: AWS services, Terraform</p>
                <p>Common problems in: dependency management, CI etc. </p>
                <p>Fundamentals: CS topics, language characteristics</p>
                <p>Placement knowledge: Savers, Wireless</p>
                <p>Go: "tech test"</p>
                <p>MAIN</p>
            </ul>

                Asked Jeremy for feedback, he says i can be dismissive. Haven't got feedback from Jem.
